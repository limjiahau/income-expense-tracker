# Income & Expense Tracker built with Streamlit including NoSQL Database 

Keep track of my monthly income and expenses on a web app created with Streamlit, leveraging Python and the Streamlit library to build an interactive web application. I used the free NoSQL Database from deta (https://deta.sh).
To visualize the monthly spending, I am using a Sankey Chart from Plotly.
